Project Overview:
Understanding the problem statement
Understanding the solution
Code understanding and walkthrough
Understanding the deployment

Under deployment, we use below applications/softwares:
Docker
Cloud services
Adding self hosted runner
Workflows

===========================================================================

Problem Statement:
US Visa Approval status
Given certain set of features such as (Continent, Edu, Job Exp., training, employment, current age etc., ), we have to predict whether the application will be approved or not.

Solution approach:
Machine Learning - ML Classification algorithm
Deep learning - Custom ANN with Sigmoid activation

Solution proposed:
We will be using ML based approach for this.

- Load the data from DB
- Perform EDA and feature engineering
- Fit the ML Classification algorithm and findout which one performs better
- Select top few and perform hyper parameter tuning
- Select the best model based on desired metrics

==========================================================================

While creating folder structure, first create
template.py - This contains the structure of the complete project. This is used for creating the structure automatically.
This file uses, from pathlib import Path

Then we use "from setuptools import setup, find_packages"
This is for installing required packages from requirements file

Now, create a new environment, visa and activate the env
conda create -p visa python==3.8 -y
conda activate visa/

In requirements.txt, we give '-e .'
This look for setup.py and this file look for constructor files in every folder. And this make the folders as local packages, so that we can import them in any of the local files

Now, just check 'pip list'. This contains the basic packages like pip and setuptools
Now, if we execute requirements.txt with 'pip install -r requirements.txt', will install all packages.
Now, do pip list. You can find all packages along with us-visa package
